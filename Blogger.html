                    Fort jesus was a Portuguese fort built in 1593 on Mombasa Island.
                    It was built to secure the safety of the Portuguese living on the East Coast of Africa,
                    and it experienced more turbulence than any other fort in Africa due to the hostilities
                    of interested parties that lived in Mombasa. It was attacked by the Omani Arabs
                    from 1696 to 1698, and was used as barracks for soldiers and a prison by the British between 1837 and 1895.
                    The fort was designed by an Italian architect and engineer, Joao Batista Cairato.

                    Even compared to buildings constructed today, The Colloseum is still impressive and 
                       stands proudly as a memory of Roman imperial power and cruelty. Romans had used the Colloseum
                       to kill thousands of people they thought as being criminals as well as inviting in professional 
                       fighters and animals.

               The pyramids of Giza are the only surviving Ancient Wonder of the World and one of the most famous tourist attractions in
                the modern world. They are some of the oldest sacred sites in our index and certainly among of the most impressive.
                Although it is clear the the pyramids were used for the burial of pharaohs, the construction date, and possible symbolism of the 
                Giza pyramids are still not entirely understood. This mystery only adds to the attractiveness of these ancient wonders and many
                modern people still regard Giza as a spiritual place.

           The ruins of Machu Picchu, rediscovered in 1911 by Yale archaeologist Hiram Bingham, are one of the most 
           beautiful and enigment ancient sites in the world. While the Inca people certainly used the Andean mountain
           top (9060 feet elevation), erecting many hundreds of stone structures from the early 1400's, legends and myths indicate that Machu Picchu
           (meaning 'Old Peak' in the Quechua language) was revered as a sacred place from a far earlier time. Whatever its origins,
           the Inca turned the site into a small(5 square miles) but extraordinary city. Invisible from below and completely self-contained,
           surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to feed the population, and watered by natural springs, Machu Picchu seems to have been 
           utilized by the Inca as a secret ceremonial city.

            Petra (petra meaning: rock) is a historical and archaeological city in the Jordanian governate of Ma'an that is famous for its
            rock cut architecture and water conduits system. Established sometime around the 6th century BC as the capital city of the Nabataeans,
            it is a symbol of Jordan as well as its most visited tourist attraction. It lies on the slope of Mount Hor in a basin among the mountains
            which form the eastern flank of Arabah (Wadi Araba), the large valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.
            Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.

            The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
            It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
            Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticised by some of France's leading artists 
            and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. 
            The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. The tower is 324 metres tall, 
            about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.

               The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and powdered dirt.
               It was finished in 1878[1] and it was meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure
               humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometres (13,171 miles) long, 9.1 metres (30feet) wide and 15 metres (50feet) high.
               The earlier sections on the wall are made of compacted dirt and stones. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks.
               There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldires and beacons to send smoke signals.
